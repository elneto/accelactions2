  “SDG Acceleration Actions” are initiatives voluntarily undertaken by countries
  and other stakeholders to contribute to a speeded up implementation of the
  2030 Agenda. Such acceleration actions can be registered by national
  Governments, local and regional governments, the United Nations system, other
  intergovernmental organizations, international and regional financial
  institutions, major groups and other stakeholders including the private
  sector, civil society organizations, academic and research institutions, the
  scientific community, and other actors - individually or in partnership.
