  Four years into the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable
  Development Goals (SDGs), many Governments, UN entities, international and
  regional organizations, Major Groups and other Stakeholders, are planning or
  have initiated evidence-based stock-taking of progress.
  <br />
  <br />
  What are the inspiring breakthroughs and success stories that are showing
  results and impacts? What are the good practices that can be replicated and
  scaled up? What are the gaps and constraints and how should we address them?
  Looking ahead, what steps should we take to accelerate progress?
  <br />
  <br />
  To help answer these and other questions, the United Nations Department of
  Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) had launched a call for submissions of
  good practices, success stories and lessons learned by all stakeholders in the
  implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs and the results are made
  available in an online database of more than 500 good practices. To search the
  submissions including by sorting them by individual SDGs, click
  <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/browse/">here</a>
  and select the "SDG Good Practices" checkbox under the "Action Network &
  Databases" section in the left column.
